			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>Hello, my name is Ryan, I am a Software Engineering major at the Rochester Institute of Technology. I hail from Lancaster, NY which is a suburb of Buffalo, NY. I attended Lancaster High School and graduated in 2023, while a student I participated in various extracurricular activities such as the LHS Model United Nations, Tech Club, Computer Programming Club and was a member of the French Honor Society. Outside of school, I was a member of Scouts BSA Troop 618 Elma, NY where I acheived the rank of Eagle Scout. Some hobbies of mine and things I like to do in my free time include, 3d printing, hiking, camping, various other outdoor activities, and as of more recently indoor bouldering.</p>
